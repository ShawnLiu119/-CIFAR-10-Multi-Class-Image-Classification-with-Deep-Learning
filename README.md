# Multi-Class-Image-Classification-with-Deep-Learning
Multi-Class Image Classification with Deep Learning using CNN / DNN with hyperparameter tuning


### Abstract
Multi-class image classification has been one of application areas under computer vision domain where deep learning has achieved great progress in last decade together with object detection and image segmentation. As one of deep learning model structure, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been proved to outperform other models especially in image classification because of its advantageous capability to extract features from the input images and evolve based on self-learning. In this research, the CIFAR dataset, a collection of color images evenly distributing across 10 class objects including bird, cat, automobile and so on, has been used to training and testing of multiple DNN and CNN models. The primary objective of this research is to compare the performance of CNN versus DNN on image classification, to experiment with differentiated model structure in terms of number of layers and regularization, and to explore how number of layers and regularization such as dropout and batch normalization impact the model performance.

### Introduction
Visual object recognition has been one of focused areas where a lot of artificial intelligence studiers attempt to train machine to mimic human being capability of detecting and recognizing images which vary in position, scale, pose and so on. Recently, deep neural networks have achieved impressive progress in this area, while CNN outperforms others due to its advantageous capability of extracting features from images through self-learning (Tien 2018). In the research, several experiments are conducted to experiment with neural network including DNN and CNN on CIFAR-10 dataset as shown in Figure 1, which is one of the well-known dataset of natural images.

The main object of conducting these experiments is to make fair comparison between Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) against typical Dense Neural Network (DNN) to explore how specialized feature learning capabilities enable it to excel in image recognition. While at a more granular level, multiple model structures with variety of number of layers including convolutional and pooling layers are experimented to explore the impact on model performance. Additionally, regularization such as dropout and batch normalization, and data augmentation are applied on the base model to testify whether these add-on can help improve model performance.
